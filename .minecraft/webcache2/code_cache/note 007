God, when will I die?
When will I stop being loved because,
When will the sun melt into blood
And my heart will be as hard as delusion?

They are far away and wise to hold back,
Love is not yet, love is not yet...
When he leaves, half of my soul is lost,
Half of my soul is suddenly foolish.

Am i still here or where?
Who brought me deep left under heaven?
Why do phoenix flowers bloom in the color of blood,
Droplets of pearls on my heart?
